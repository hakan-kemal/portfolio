In order to increase my changes of getting hired I decided to create my own impressive portfolio website. My portfolio aims to showcase my current skill level and present my completed projects.

## My portfolio website is currently under construction and the readme will follow.

Some contents of the README could be:

A description of the goal and purpose of the website:

- The goal of the website explained in a concise sentence and list the functionalities.

- The purpose of the website also explained in a concise sentence.

- What is it? Clearly, indicate what the code is supposed to produce. Is it a web, desktop, mobile app, game, or a library?

- Used technologies?: List all important framework and libraries that contribute to this project.

- What is the ambition of the project? Are you just test-driving a technology or is it something that is or will go live somewhere?

- What is the stage of the project? Clearly, indicate where you are with it. Whether it is complete or a work in progress? If it's a work in progress indicate what is done and what is pending.

- List any known issues or things that are not working or not properly done? If so, please list them because people will be much more tolerant when and if they find shortcomings that have been highlighted than if the person discovers themselfs. Always be clear and honest about you code.

- A clear and precise explanation of how to run.

- Running a demo version of your project must one-liner activity such as npm run, serve, docker run, etc. Or what is used by the framework.

### Above list is not an exhaustive list but it shows some important contents that the readme should contain.
